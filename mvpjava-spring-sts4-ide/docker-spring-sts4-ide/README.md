RUN CONTAINER 
==============
In order to run the STS4 container, run script ...

./run.sh

You should see the Spring Tools 4 Splash screen show up 
after the initial Docker image download from DockerHub.
Just accept the defauly directory location for your workspace
since it is volume mapped back to you host.

./exec.sh

You'll find yourself in a bash shell



RE-BUILDING IMAGE

else in the Dockerfile, you could run script ...
